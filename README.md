## ‚ú® About The Project

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a digital statement. The goal was to move beyond static pages and create an immersive, memorable experience that reflects my passion for cutting-edge technology and elegant design. The entire site is a single-page application built with a modern, high-performance tech stack, featuring complex 3D visuals, fluid scroll-driven animations, and a fully responsive layout.

Every section, from the "Neural Journey" of my education to the showcase of my projects, was meticulously crafted to tell a story and demonstrate technical proficiency.

### Key Features:

*   **Interactive 3D Hero Section:** A stunning, mouse-reactive `TorusKnot` model rendered with React Three Fiber.
*   **Scroll-Driven Animations:** The entire site is animated on scroll using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for a fluid, narrative-driven experience.
*   **"Neural Journey" Timeline:** A unique, custom-built SVG timeline that animates to visualize my academic and professional path.
*   **Dynamic Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** A flawless viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones to 4K desktops.
*   **Performance Optimized:** Built with Next.js for Static Site Generation (SSG), ensuring lightning-fast load times and a perfect Lighthouse score.
